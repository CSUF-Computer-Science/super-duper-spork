# Sporkify
A project for CPSC 362 Foundations of Software Engineering at CSUF Fall 2018
#### Description:
```
Initial iterations of an inventory, sales and employee management system built to meet the needs of a small business owner who deals in selling electronics online via sites like Ebay and Amazon.
```
#### Why The Spork:
```
When creating our initial repository github suggested "super-duper-spork" as its name.
At the time we were in need of a group name so we embraced the recommendation and Sporkify evolved from there.
